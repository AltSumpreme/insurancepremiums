## Project Description

Insurance premiums can vary significantly based on factors such as age, gender, health status, and more. This project focuses on predicting insurance premiums specifically for different age groups. It utilizes machine learning techniques and a dataset of insurance records to make these predictions.

**Note**: This project is still under development, and the accuracy of the predictions may improve as more data is collected and models are fine-tuned.
